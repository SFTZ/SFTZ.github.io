                SABR works with "over the counter"  platforms, where buyers and sellers are paired, allowing them to conduct large transactions off the exchanges and free from wild price swings. The benefit to you is you can get more coins at the current price or for large orders even below the market price, than what is available on exchange. Thus, you can get into a SABR position much easier/cheaper than would otherwise be possible. Request an OTC trade via email and a suitable solution will be provided.
